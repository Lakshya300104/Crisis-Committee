            <h2>What is a Crisis Committee?</h2>
            <p>
                A Crisis Committee in a Model United Nations (MUN) conference represents a dynamic and high-pressure format designed to simulate complex and urgent situations requiring immediate and strategic responses. Unlike traditional MUN committees which follow a set agenda, Crisis Committees introduce evolving scenarios that require delegates to think on their feet, make rapid decisions, and adapt their strategies as the crisis unfolds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delegates in a Crisis Committee are assigned specific roles representing various characters, nations, or entities, each with their own objectives and perspectives. The format challenges delegates to manage and resolve crises through collaboration, negotiation, and strategic planning. The success of the committee depends on the delegates' ability to handle unforeseen developments and implement effective solutions in real-time.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="procedure">
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>
                The procedural framework of a Crisis Committee is structured to ensure both order and flexibility, allowing for a controlled yet adaptable session. The primary procedural components are as follows:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Roll Call</h3>
            <p>
                The session commences with a roll call, where the Executive Board (EB) sequentially calls out the names of delegates. Delegates are expected to respond with "present" or remain silent. This process confirms the presence of delegates and establishes the quorum required for the committee's proceedings to be valid. It is crucial for the EB to ascertain which delegates are present before moving forward with the agenda.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Opening Statements</h3>
            <p>
                After the roll call, the EB calls for opening statements from the delegates. The sequence of these statements is determined either by the Executive Board. During this phase, each delegate presents their portfolio’s perspective on the current agenda. The EB sets specific time limits for each statement to ensure equitable participation. These opening statements are critical as they outline the delegates' positions and set the stage for subsequent discussions. Delegates may use Laptops, Mobile Phones or Paper for their speaches.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Crisis Update</h3>
            <p>
                Following the opening statements, the EB delivers a crisis update. This update introduces new developments or information that impacts the ongoing crisis. It may include changes in the situation, new intelligence, or actions by other stakeholders. The crisis update is pivotal as it prompts delegates to reassess their strategies and responses. The EB decides the time allocated for each delegate’s response to the update, ensuring that all voices are heard and that the discussion remains focused. Depending on the time remaining and the committee's progression, multiple updates may be issued, each adding layers of complexity to the crisis.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="chits">
            <h2>Chits</h2>
            <p>
                Chits are formal written communications used in Crisis Committees to address various issues discretely and efficiently. The different types of chits facilitate private interactions and procedural management:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Point of Order Chit</h3>
            <p>
                A Point of Order Chit is utilized by delegates to address any procedural errors or factual inaccuracies identified during the committee's proceedings. This chit allows delegates to formally raise concerns about procedural breaches or incorrect information presented by other delegates. The EB reviews the chit to determine its validity; if deemed valid, corrective measures are implemented. If not, the proceedings continue without modification. This process ensures that the committee adheres to procedural standards and maintains the integrity of the debate.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Point of Information (POI) Chit</h3>
            <p>
                The Point of Information Chit allows delegates to pose questions to other delegates during the committee session. To use this chit, the delegate must include their own portfolio, the portfolio of the delegate they are questioning, and the specific question. If the delegate wishes the EB to formally acknowledge the question, this should be indicated; otherwise, the question is sent directly to the intended recipient. This mechanism enables delegates to seek clarifications, gather additional information, and challenge statements made during discussions.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Point of Information (Reply) Chit</h3>
            <p>
                A POI Reply Chit is used to respond to a previously issued Point of Information. The reply chit must include the responding delegate’s portfolio, the portfolio of the delegate being responded to, and the word "Reply" at the top. The delegate can choose to have the reply formally acknowledged by the EB or send it directly. This chit facilitates direct responses to queries and helps clarify or counter points raised by other delegates.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="rights">
            <h2>Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Rights are essential entitlements that ensure fair and equitable participation in a Crisis Committee. These rights protect delegates' ability to engage effectively and address any concerns:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Right to Reply</h3>
            <p>
                The Right to Reply is a procedural entitlement that allows a delegate to respond when their portfolio is specifically targeted or criticized during another delegate's speech. The decision to grant this right is at the discretion of the EB. If granted, the delegate may only address the specific criticism or attack rather than delivering a general speech. This ensures that delegates can defend their positions or correct inaccuracies without deviating from the procedural norms.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Point of Information (POI)</h3>
            <p>
                When a delegate yields their time for Points of Information, they open the floor for questions. Delegates seeking to ask questions must be recognized by the EB. Questions may pertain to the delegate’s speech or the overall agenda. This process fosters interactive dialogue and allows for clarification and elaboration on discussed points, enhancing the overall engagement and depth of the committee’s discussions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="points">
            <h2>Points</h2>
            <p>
                Points are formal procedural requests made by delegates to address specific matters within the committee. They serve to manage the flow of the session and address any procedural or personal needs:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Point of Information (POI)</h3>
            <p>
                Points of Information may be raised both verbally during discussions or submitted via chit. This point allows delegates to ask questions and seek clarification on issues raised by others. It is a critical tool for ensuring transparency and engagement, enabling delegates to actively participate and challenge or clarify points made during the session.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Point of Inquiry</h3>
            <p>
                A Point of Inquiry is used when delegates need clarification on procedural aspects, wish to resolve points of confusion, or require additional information that they may have missed. This point ensures that delegates fully understand the proceedings and can participate effectively without misunderstandings.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Point of Order</h3>
            <p>
                As detailed in the Chits section, a Point of Order addresses procedural breaches or factual inaccuracies. Delegates use this point to highlight issues with the committee’s procedures or to correct misinformation. The EB reviews these points to ensure that the session adheres to the established rules and maintains procedural integrity.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Point of Personal Privilege</h3>
            <p>
                This point is used for personal matters, such as requesting a break for personal needs or addressing discomfort. It allows delegates to manage personal issues without disrupting the committee's proceedings. The EB typically grants this point to accommodate delegates' personal requirements while ensuring minimal disruption to the session.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="eb-role">
            <h2>EB Role</h2>
            <p>
                The Executive Board (EB) plays a crucial role in the effective management and functioning of a Crisis Committee. Their responsibilities encompass a wide range of tasks designed to facilitate smooth and productive sessions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitating roll calls, opening statements, and crisis presentations to ensure that procedural requirements are met and that all delegates have the opportunity to contribute.</li>
                <li>Moderating discussions, managing speaking time, and overseeing Points of Information (POIs) to maintain order, manage the flow of debate, and ensure balanced participation.</li>
                <li>Introducing crisis situations and providing necessary context to guide the committee’s discussions and decision-making processes. This involves presenting new developments and challenges relevant to the ongoing crisis.</li>
                <li>Adjudicating Right to Reply requests and resolving procedural disputes to address any concerns raised by delegates and ensure adherence to the committee’s rules and procedures.</li>
                <li>Upholding the rules of procedure and ensuring fair participation for all delegates, fostering an environment of respect and professionalism throughout the session.</li>
                <li>Deciding on the adoption of resolutions and concluding the committee session effectively by facilitating the decision-making process and summarizing the outcomes of the committee’s deliberations.</li>
                <li>Allocating time for speeches and responses to ensure that all delegates have an equitable opportunity to present their views and respond to crisis updates or questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="dos-donts">
            <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
            <p>
                Adhering to the do's and don'ts is essential for maintaining decorum and ensuring a productive and respectful environment in the Crisis Committee. The following guidelines outline acceptable and unacceptable behaviors:
            </p>
            <h3>Do's</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare thoroughly by understanding the agenda, your assigned role, and the context of the crisis. Comprehensive preparation enhances your effectiveness and contributes to meaningful discussions.</li>
                <li>Participate actively in discussions, offering constructive insights and engaging respectfully with other delegates. Active participation ensures that your perspective is heard and contributes to the committee’s overall effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Utilize chits and points appropriately to address procedural or factual issues, and seek clarifications as necessary. Proper use of these tools helps manage procedural aspects and resolve any issues that arise.</li>
                <li>Respect the EB’s decisions and adhere to procedural rules to maintain order and fairness throughout the session. Compliance with rules ensures that the committee operates smoothly and that all delegates have an equal opportunity to participate.</li>
                <li>Present your arguments clearly and support them with relevant information and evidence. Well-structured arguments enhance the credibility of your position and facilitate productive debate.</li>
                <li>Engage in diplomatic and professional conduct at all times, reflecting the standards of MUN decorum. Maintaining a professional demeanor fosters a respectful and constructive environment for all participants.</li>
                <li>Ensure that all electronic devices are set to silent mode to avoid disruptions. While the use of electronics is permitted, the use of the internet is generally prohibited during the session to maintain focus on the committee’s discussions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don'ts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not interrupt other delegates while they are speaking; utilize Points of Order or Points of Information as necessary to address concerns. Interruptions disrupt the flow of discussion and hinder productive dialogue.</li>
                <li>Avoid making personal attacks or derogatory remarks; maintain a respectful and professional tone in all communications. Personal attacks undermine the committee’s professionalism and detract from constructive debate.</li>
                <li>Do not engage in disruptive behavior or create unnecessary disturbances; adhere to the committee’s rules and procedures. Disruptive behavior impedes the committee’s progress and affects the overall environment.</li>
                <li>Refrain from using the internet or external resources during the session, as the focus should remain on the committee’s discussions and proceedings. Utilizing external resources can distract from the committee’s objectives and impact the quality of deliberations.</li>
                <li>Do not ignore procedural rules or the EB’s instructions; ensure compliance to facilitate effective committee functioning. Adhering to procedural rules ensures that the session runs smoothly and that all delegates are treated fairly.</li>
            </ul>
